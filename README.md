This application will estimate using WRPR index your worthiness as a planeteer.


How it Works:

Rules: 
•Be honest when answering the questions.
•After you answered all the questions hit the calculate WRPR (worth regarding plastic recycling)index button.

Score interpretation:
•If you get a score higher than 0 and heading to 100, you definetely hurt the planet through your actions.
•If you get a score under 0 or close to 0 you are worthy for this planet.

Bugs:
•If you change answers to many times, the calculate button may display the same result, in this case I advise to use the reset button.
•This application behavior may also occur when you are entering to many wrong answers, in this case I also advise to use the reset button.
